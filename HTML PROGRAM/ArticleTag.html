		<h1>What is Computer</h1>
		<p>Computers are used in many fields like banking, medicine, finance and education with increased preference. With the growth of artificial intelligence, computers will soon blur lines between man and machine.

Under such circumstances, a rudimentary knowledge of computers is essential for everyday work. For those who are not yet familiar with computers, now is the time to gain knowledge about this field. As children will be living with this scenario in future, their employment capability will be tested against computers. To make them future-ready, it is essential to prepare them for this inevitability.

You may have been using your computer for ages without knowing what its essential components, history, or even computer definition are. But now with your children ready to take the next step into learning computers, you may be beset by various questions that you cannot seem to answer.

This article is for those parents and their children who want to know what a computer is and what its various components are?

 

Definition of a Computer
While you may have seen and used a computer but you may still be unable to answer what is computer correctly. There are many ways of defining a computer. The first and most standard definition is that a computer is something which computes or calculates. It is a machine that takes in raw data and performs some calculations on it and gives us the formed output in the desired format.

Computer is also a device that stores as well as processes information electronically. Computers usually come in different sizes and grades of functionalities.

 

Brief History of Computers
This journey of computers began in 1822 with Charles Babbage’s analytical engine, which was used to compute the product of numbers. Lady Ada Lovelace, considered to be the world’s first programmer, helped with the programming of the analytical engine.

Around a hundred years later, Alan Turing presented a concept of a universal machine which could theoretically compute anything.

Then J.V. Atanasoff, from the University of Iowa, actually made the first attempt to build a computer. But the first concrete effort came from two University of Pennsylvania professors who built the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator) which filled an entire room and had around 18,000 vacuum tubes.

Two years later, a green light for building UNIVAC came from the US government to make the first computer for commercial and business applications. Then came a fundamental design switch to transistors a year later when transistors replaced vacuum tubes. This paved the way for integrated circuits which form the processor chip of modern computers.

In 1953, the first programming language COBOL was developed, and FORTRAN followed it up. But the shift of computers beyond the scientific world came in 1964 when Douglas Engelbart showed a computer prototype with a mouse and a Graphical User Interface. It made computers user friendly and made them favourable for general use.

Following this, there was a parabolic rise in the development of computers with Bell Laboratories, IBM and Apple Inc. They made significant headways into the development of computers.

Apple announced the new personal computers that eventually took over the market in 1976. This was followed up by Microsoft’s Windows. These two significant companies prove to be the game changers in the personal computer field, and the rest is history.

 

Types of Computers
Computers can be differentiated based on their modes of functioning as well as their size and functionality. Here they have been divided into different types of computers without considering any of these factors.

Analogue

These are old models of computers that work on the continuous analogue signals rather than discrete signals. They are not very accurate but extremely fast.

Digital

Computers that use this binary system of counting using electrical pulses of ON and OFF are known as digital computers. They function on discrete values and are generally more accurate.

Hybrid

Computers that have features of both digital and analogue computers are known as hybrid computers. The analogue part of a computer handles very complicated mathematical computations while digital components handle these numerical and logical systems.

Mainframes

Mainframe computers are computers that are accessed simultaneously by several thousands of people at once. They are used in fields of banking and telecom where they have to handle millions of requests together in minimal time.

Supercomputers

These massive computers are used in the fields of engineering and scientific computations. They usually perform over a million instructions per second.

Servers

Servers are large repositories of information. They supply information to any computer that is on the same network as them. Many people access servers at the same time so servers need to handle large amounts of traffic.

Workstation

This type of computer that scientists and engineers may be familiar with is called the workstation. It is generally used in scientific applications and has a faster microprocessor along with a spacious memory.

Microcomputer

This last type of computer is a microcomputer which is nothing but a personal computer that you use at home. These computers are built for light use such as listening to music, or playing movies or accessing the internet.

This list concludes various types of computers that are available right now the world over.

 

Basics of a Computer
Computer basics should be known to everybody who has ever used a computer. A computer is a device that computes some raw data and turns it into meaningful information.

Computer systems consist mainly of two parts. They are hardware and software. The hardware is electronic circuitry that helps to compute the mathematical computations, and the software is the programs that help the hardware to compute. Software is further subdivided into two parts, the operating systems and applications programs. The operating system runs the computer hardware and helps us to communicate with the computer while software applications that we run further perform useful tasks for us.

 

Hardware vs Software
These are the primary divisions of the computer system.

While discussing the computer definition, we understand that there are two broad divisions of the computer. They are the hardware and the software. The hardware is that part of the computer that we can physically see, feel, touch. They include the input and output devices as well as the processor chip itself.

While the software is those programs which perform tasks, for example, the very browser that you are using to view this program is a software. Software is of two types. One is the operating system like Windows and LINUX, and the other part is the application software like MS Office, games, internet browsers etc. The computer without the software is nothing but a dumb machine. The software is what makes the computer useful to humans.

The computer's meaning should be clear to you now.

 

Hardware
Computer hardware is the physical parts of a computer device. Hardware can be replaced if broken or as per needs. Hardware can also be seen as the machinery or primary electronic part of the computer devices. These are used to build up the computer and bring it into a usable condition. For Example- Monitors, Central Processing Unit (CPU), etc.

 

Softwares
Software in a computer system is a programming code that is executed on a computer processor to fulfill the required task. It is a set of programs and procedures that can perform the given tasks. Softwares is generally written or designed in high-level programming languages which are also readable by non-technical people and the user of the computer. 

The high-level languages of software are converted to machine language instructions which can be understood by the computer to follow. These are represented in the form of binary code  (0s and 1s) which is understood by the device. The installation of software occurs in the machine language or binary code.
